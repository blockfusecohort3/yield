# 🌱 Yield MVP – Decentralized Agro-Finance Platform

## 📌 Overview
**Yield** is a decentralized agro-finance platform built to solve one of Nigeria’s biggest challenges: cls
**affordable access to financing for smallholder farmers**.  

Nigeria serves as our **proof of concept**, where smallholder farmers face significant barriers to accessing credit. By leveraging **blockchain and smart contracts**, we connect farmers and investors directly, ensuring **trust, transparency, and milestone-based disbursement of funds**.  

Our vision is to **scale across African markets and other developing countries** where similar financing gaps exist, unlocking opportunities for millions of smallholder farmers.
